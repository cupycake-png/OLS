# OLS
OLS (Open Language Server) is a language server written in C++ initially for the larger project of my code editor (https://github.com/cupycake-png/cupycode) but I am releasing it as a standalone project as, since it utilises the Language Server Protocol, it will hopefully be able to be used with other text editors.
